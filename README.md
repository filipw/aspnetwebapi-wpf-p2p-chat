Build p2p chat application with WPF and ASP.NET Web API
=========================

This source code is accompanying the tutorial from here - http://www.strathweb.com/2012/03/build-p2p-chat-application-with-wpf-and-asp-net-web-api/

Please note that the tutorial was written some time ago against ASP.NET Web API Beta, so it might not compile against the latest project DLLs (update coming soon).

The solution file is Visual Studio 11.

Enjoy.
